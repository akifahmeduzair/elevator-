# elevator-
This code simulates an elevator scheduling system that explores two common scheduling algorithms: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Nearest-Neighbor. Users can define the requested floors they want to visit, and optionally provide a separate priority order for the FIFO algorithm, allowing for customization of the servicing order.
